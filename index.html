            </h3>

                My inspiration for web development comes from several sources. I look at websites I enjoy using to see
                what makes them great. I also participate in online communities where developers share their works &
                ideas, which keeps me motivated & informed. Finally, I often draw my inspiration from my personal
                interests and the problems I want to solve, which makes my project more enjoyable & meaningful.
